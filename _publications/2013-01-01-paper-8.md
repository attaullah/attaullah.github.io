Abstract: Internet has changed this world into the Global village. Communication is the only way to survive. There are
several ways and channels to communicate each other. Nowadays, we are communicating with each other through
different mediums like text messages, voice and video calls etc. Chatting is one of them. Understanding the moods
each other can be a strong tool for better relationships. We often start chatting without knowing mood of our
opponent and may get unpredictable responses. To avoid this we can start a topic according to the mood. To
overcome this issue, a simple technique is proposed in this study. This study is undertaken to create an effective
environment by chatting; where chatting is done through voice, the voice will be converted into text then applying
simple techniques of data mining with Na√Øve Bayes, the emotions of the opponent will be sensed.
