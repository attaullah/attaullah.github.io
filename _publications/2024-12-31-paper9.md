Abstract: Amid increasing concerns about skin diseases exacerbated by climate change or lifestyle, some diseases are undiagnosed or misdiagnosed due to limited healthcare facilities. The worldwide health burden emphasizes the need for innovative diagnostics. This study explores the evolutionary role of deep learning in skin disease detection, providing the most advanced and effective research approaches, model achievements, and dataset usage exclusively. The review adapts data from 30 research papers and many datasets to address imbalanced class and various efficiency factors. The developments in CNN models like MobileNet or EfficientNet, have strengthened computational potential, while hybrid models have accommodated local and global features. Furthermore, Explainable AI (EXI) and augmented datasets have overcome the challenges including noisy, biased datasets and the less interpretable AI models. This study declares the innovative capacity of deep learning in dermatological analysis, highlighting its scalability and performance. Future research is required to consider dataset diversity, interpretability, and incorporating medical metadata to enhance model performances.
