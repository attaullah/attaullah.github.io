In this tutorial, I introduce the machine learning fundamentals and classification algorithms in details. I also demonstrated applying Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and Random Forest algorithms using [WEKA] (https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/) (Waikato Environment for KNowledge Analysis) tool on simple dataset.
