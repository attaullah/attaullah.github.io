This is a draft course description for CE-02: Computer Graphicse taught in Fall 2022.

Course content
======
Fundamental Concepts: forward and backward rendering (i.e., ray-casting and rasterization), applications of computer graphics: including game engines, cad, visualization, virtual reality, polygonal representation, basic radiometry, similar triangles, and projection model, use of standard graphics APIs (see HCI GUI construction); basic rendering: rendering in nature, i.e., the emission and scattering of light and its relation to numerical integration, affine and coordinate system transformations, ray tracing, visibility and occlusion, including solutions to this problem such as depth buffering, painterâ€™s algorithm, and ray tracing, the forward and backward rendering equation, simple triangle rasterization, rendering with a shader-based API, texture mapping, including minification and magnification (e.g., trilinear MIP-mapping), application of spatial data structures to rendering, sampling and anti-aliasing, scene graphs and the graphics pipeline; geometric modeling: basic geometric operations such as intersection calculation, proximity tests, polynomial curves and surfaces, approximation techniques such as polynomial curves, bezier curves, spline curves and surfaces, animation as a sequence of still images.
